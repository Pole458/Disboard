Disboard is an engine written in c++ made for studying AI for sequential turn based games.

The engine comes with two types of AI, one based on the MiniMax algorhitm and one on the Monte Carlo Tree Search.
These AIs have both a sequential implementation and a parallel one that leverages OpenMP.

The AI are costumizable
